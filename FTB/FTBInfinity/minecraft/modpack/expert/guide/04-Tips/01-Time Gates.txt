§2§lTime Gates
§0There are few time gates in Expert mode to be aware of, so you don't get stuck waiting forever.

1) Pure certus quartz crystal needed for the Inscriber will take 16h real life time to create.

2) Machine frames and iridium, as well as other higher tier materials, can take a long time in the assembly table to create. Gradually increasing the amount of lasers you have as you go will help offset this a bit.
