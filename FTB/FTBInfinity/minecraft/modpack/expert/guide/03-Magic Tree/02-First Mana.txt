§2§lYour first Mana
§0Botania is where the magic adventure kicks off.  So gather a few Botania flowers and make the petal apothecary.
It may be worth the time to get the Agricraft versions of the Botania flowers, but that is not required.

Apothecary:

[petal]

Then make your pure daisies,  if you still need a bucket to get water into it see getting the bucket.

[puredaisy]

From here it is fairly basic progression as normal start of Botania, but here is is for reference:

[livingwood]
[livingrock]

Diluted Mana pool:

[dmanapool]

Then some basic generating flora:

[daybloom]
[nightshade]

Then a regular mana pool:

[manapool]

Once you have that initial setup, then we would want to increase that mana generation with some endoflames:

[endoflame]

Then you can start producing your mana items (pearls/steel/glass) which you will need for many other magic recipes.

Note: Manasteel can be made from either steel or iron, however iron is double the mana cost:

[manasteel1]
[manasteel2]

Now you have the basics you will need to start the magic adventure!
